<li>This project is an interactive data visualization that explores the relationship between car origin and fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (MPG). The visualization utilizes the Altair library in Python, along with data from the Vega datasets.</li>
<li>The main component of the visualization is a bar chart that displays the average MPG for cars from different origins (e.g., USA, Europe, Japan). The bars are color-coded based on user interaction through a brushing selection mechanism. When the user selects a specific bar (representing a particular car origin), the corresponding bar is highlighted in a distinct color (steelblue), while the unselected bars are grayed out.</li>
<li>Accompanying the bar chart is a horizontal line chart that displays the individual MPG values for all cars in the dataset. This line chart is linked to the bar chart through the brushing selection, allowing users to see the distribution of MPG values for the selected car origin.</li>
<li>In addition to the two main charts, the visualization includes two data tables displayed side by side. These tables show the car origin and MPG values for the top 15 cars based on the user&rsquo;s selection. The data tables are dynamically updated to reflect the cars corresponding to the selected origin in the bar chart.</li>
